### **wtwr** is a weather app that gives you clothing suggestions based on the weather (checked at load) and the clothing that you add to your virtual wardrobe! Perfect for anyone who has trouble choosing outfits!

### Technologies Utilized

- React (hooks and component based file structure)
- Javascript (in the form of JSX)
- HTML & CSS
